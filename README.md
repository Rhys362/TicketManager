# TicketManager
WinForms task management application with CRM database and Excel funcionality 

Instructions:

To compile this program, a copy of Visual Studio 2015 is required.

Download the zip file and unzip to desired location or copy the link into GitClone. Once program files have been downloaded open TicketManager.sln and compile and build in Visual Studio.

Update: I came back to this project after 4 years and decided to overhaul and update it with more features. Currently building a fully fledged CRM with winforms (it's still useful!) and will post it in another repository

Also realised I never advised people to build the necessary datatables and connections to compile this app, something that will be addressed in the new version.
